# Triangle-Area-Calculator

This is an academic project in Java that calculates the area of a triangle based on user-provided base and height values. The program includes two classes: Triangle, which models the triangle properties and calculation, and Main, which handles user input and displays the area result.

### Project Structure

model/Triangle.java: Contains the Triangle class, which has fields for base and height, as well as methods to set and get these values. It also includes a method to calculate the area.

main/Main.java: Contains the main method, which creates a Triangle object, prompts the user to input the base and height, and then displays the calculated area.

### How to Run

Compile both Triangle.java and Main.java.

Run Main, which will prompt you to enter the base and height of the triangle.

The program will output the calculated area.

### Key Challenges

One of the main challenges of this project was handling user input and ensuring that the area calculation is accurate for decimal values. Using Scanner.nextDouble() for input allows the program to accept floating-point numbers, mak
